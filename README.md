# Maldev-Academy
Source code for projects I've completed as part of [MalDev Academy](https://maldevacademy.com), which is an online academy offering module-based malware development training and resources.

Most of these were supplied as empty templates, which I've adapted and/or filled in order to finish the assignments.
